# Pentesting-Live-Targets

> Objective: Identify vulnerabilities in three different versions of the Globitek website: blue, green, and red.

The six possible exploits are:

* Username Enumeration
* Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR)
* SQL Injection (SQLi)
* Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
* Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)
* Session Hijacking/Fixation

Each color is vulnerable to only 2 of the 6 possible exploits. First discover which color has the specific vulnerability, then write a short description of how to exploit it, and finally demonstrate it using screenshots compiled into a GIF.

## Blue

Vulnerability #1: SQL Injection (SQLi)

Description:
  - I first saw that in the Menu the "Users" "Salespeople" and "Countries, States and Territories" all had an id field in the browser
  - So I tried to use the SQL Injection on the tab "Users" "Salespeople" and "Countries, States and Territories", but it worked for the "Salespeople"
  - SQL injection Command: ```' OR SLEEP(5)=0--'```
  - This command makes the website "sleep" for 5 seconds

Vulnerability #2: Session Hijacking/Fixation

Description:
  - I opened 2 different tabs in chrome but one was normal the other was in incognito mode.
  - Session Hijacking/Fixation Command: ```change_session_id.php```
  - I logged into the normal chrome tab 
  - Then I put the command in the normal chrome tab which brought me to a page to set a new PHPSESSIONID
  - I did the same thing to the incognito mode tab but change the PHPSESSIONID to the one in the normal chrome tab
  - One I deleted the command in the incognito mode tab and hit log in it already logged me in

## Green

Description: 
  - Attacker can inject an XSS in their feedback form
  - Injected XSS Command: ```<script>alert('Sam found the XSS!');</script>```
  - This XSS runs once the account holder checks their feedback page
